# Flashcard SaaS

Flashcard SaaS is a modern web application designed to help students and professionals create, manage, and study flashcards efficiently. This application utilizes Next.js, React, Firebase, and Stripe to provide a scalable and powerful platform for flashcard management. Additionally, it integrates with OpenAI to generate flashcards from user-provided text.

## Problem Statement

Students and professionals often struggle with creating and managing flashcards efficiently due to the time-consuming and manual process involved. Existing flashcard tools either lack the advanced features needed for effective study or do not integrate well with modern web technologies. Additionally, generating flashcards from user-provided text can be cumbersome and prone to errors.

## Action

To address these challenges, we developed Flashcard SaaS using a combination of Next.js and React for a dynamic and responsive user interface. We integrated Firebase for real-time data management and Stripe for seamless payment processing. To enhance functionality, we incorporated OpenAI’s API to automate the creation of flashcards from user-provided text. This solution aimed to streamline the flashcard creation process and improve the overall user experience.

Users can now easily create, manage, and study flashcards with a modern and intuitive interface.
